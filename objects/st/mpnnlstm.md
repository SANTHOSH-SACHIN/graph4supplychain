## 1. Introduction
MPNN-LSTM forecasts COVID-19 spread by leveraging spatial-temporal mobility data and limited case reporting. Using transfer learning, the model adapts from countries with historical outbreak data to those in early stages, supporting early and accurate pandemic forecasting across regions.

## 2. Methodology
The model includes:
- *Spatial Dependency*: Modeled by MPNN to capture local interactions in each snapshot graph.
- *Temporal Dependency*: LSTM layers handle sequence learning, while transfer learning transfers insights from prior outbreak phases.
- *Mobility & Dynamics*: Explores mobility-based infection transfer across regions, considering the timing of secondary outbreaks.

## 3. Model Components
- *Spatial Aggregation*: MPNN aggregates mobility-based features per region.
- *Temporal Aggregation*: LSTM layers predict long-term trends across daily mobility patterns.
- *Transfer Learning*: MAML facilitates inter-country adaptation for more accurate early-stage predictions.

## 4. Hyperparameters
- *Learning Rate*: 0.001 (Adam optimizer)
- *Hidden Dimensions*: 64 for MPNN and LSTM
- *Batch Size*: 8
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
