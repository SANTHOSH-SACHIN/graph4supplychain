There is a Benchmark Models Folder which contains all the models as ipynb files that are used for benchmarking.
There are 4 Subfolders within this folder.
1. Homogenous
2. Heterogenous
3. Hybrid
4. Time Series

## Homogenous
This folder contains all the models that are used for benchmarking in the homogenous setting for all homogenous graph datasets.

## Heterogenous
This folder contains all the models that are used for benchmarking in the heterogenous setting for all heterogenous graph datasets.

## Hybrid
This folder contains all the models that are used for benchmarking in in both Timeseries as well as GNN based apporaches

## Time Series
This folder contains all the models that are used for benchmarking in the time series setting for all time series datasets

## Note 
- In the main application there are 4 tabs that are used for benchmarking. Some of the analysis for the benchmarking is done and the results are displayed in these tabs.

- The ipynb files for models can be found within the BenchmarkModels Folder within respective subfolders
